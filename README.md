# React Stripe Payment Integration

This project is built with **React**, utilizing modern React features like **hooks** to manage state and side effects. It also integrates **Stripe** to handle secure payments, allowing users to complete transactions directly through the application.

## Overview

The application demonstrates a full-stack payment solution using **Stripe API**. Users can add products to their cart, view their selected items, adjust quantities, and proceed to checkout. Stripe handles the payment processing, ensuring secure transactions.

### Features
- **React Functional Components and Hooks**: 
  - Utilized for clean, reusable components and state management.
  - **useState**, **useEffect**, and **useContext** hooks manage the application state and lifecycle events.
  
- **Cart Management**:
  - Add, remove, and update product quantities in the cart.
  - Dynamic cart state management using **Context API** for efficient state handling across components.
  
- **Stripe Integration**:
  - Securely process payments via Stripe.
  - Stripe Checkout integration to handle customer payment details (e.g., card number, expiration, CVV) using Stripe's pre-built UI.
  - Dynamically generate the product details, including name, quantity, and price, for Stripe checkout.

- **Responsive Design**: 
  - Optimized for different screen sizes and devices to ensure the best user experience.
